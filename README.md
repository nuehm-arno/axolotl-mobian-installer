# axolotl-mobian-installer
This simple experimental installer builds [Axolotl](https://github.com/nanu-c/axolotl) on your Mobian device.
It uses the commands from the [Axolotl page of the Mobian wiki](https://wiki.mobian-project.org/doku.php?id=axolotl) - section Manual installation.

# Use
Download the script with
```
git clone https://github.com/nuehm-arno/axolotl-mobian-installer.git
```
Please check the script before use - a restart is recommended - disable "Settings - Power - Automatic Suspend" and execute it on your phone (not via ssh) as user, not root, with
```
cd axolotl-mobian-installer
sh axolotl_mobian_installer_1-5.sh
```

It will take up to 45 minutes, so please be patient.

# First Start
The very first start of Axolotl on Mobian is also known to take a bit.

# Updates
Axolotl is under heavy development and there are regular updates. You can use the script for these updates, too.
Your registration, configuration files and messages should not be changed.
An update will take around 5-10 minutes.

# Uninstall
Has to be done...

# Disclaimer
This is an experimental script.
