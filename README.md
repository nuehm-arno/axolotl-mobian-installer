# axolotl-mobian-installer
This simple experimental installer builds [Axolotl](https://github.com/nanu-c/axolotl) on your Mobian device.
It uses the commands from the [Axolotl page](https://wiki.mobian-project.org/doku.php?id=axolotl) of the Mobian wiki - section Manual installation.

# Use
Please check the script before use, do a restart and execute it with
```
sh axolotl-installer-mobian_1-2.sh
```

It will take up to 45 minutes, so please be patient.

# Updates
Axolotl is under heavy development and there are regular updates. You can use the script for these updates, too.
Your configuration and messages should not be changed.

# Disclaimer
This is an experimental script.
