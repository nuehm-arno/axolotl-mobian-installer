# axolotl-mobian-installer
This simple experimental installer builds [Axolotl](https://github.com/nanu-c/axolotl) on your Mobian device.
It uses the commands from the [Axolotl page of the Mobian wiki](https://wiki.mobian-project.org/doku.php?id=axolotl) - section Manual installation.

# Use
Please check the script before use, do a restart, disable "Automatic Suspend" and execute it with
```
sh axolotl-mobian-installer_1-3.sh
```

It will take up to 45 minutes, so please be patient.

# Updates
Axolotl is under heavy development and there are regular updates. You can use the script for these updates, too.
Your registration, configuration files and messages should not be changed.
An update will take around 5 minutes.

This is an experimental script.
